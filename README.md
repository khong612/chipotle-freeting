# chipotle-freeting

## About This Project

The idea for this project was born out of an obsession with Chipotle and the discovery of their "freeting" promotion (tweets with unique codes for free entr√©e items) during the 2019 NBA finals.

## How It Works

The script continuously scrapes Chipotle's Twitter page using the Twitter front end API and looks for new tweets. If a new tweet has been posted, it is then parsed for the free food code ("FREE" followed by a string of random characters), and this code is sent out to a list of contacts using Twilio's API.

## Current Goals

- Repurpose this project for other free food promotions.

## Demo

Sadly there aren't any cool visuals to show off this time, but here's a picture that's pretty similar to what I like to order whenever I go to Chipotle.
